# IRONHOWL — PROGRESS (full audit of what exists right now)

Companion to `.lovable/plan.md`. This file = what is ALREADY built and working.
After every change the AI must update `.lovable/plan.md` (mark `X` on done items, or log off-list work).
Last full audit: 2026-08-19.

---

## 1. App shell & boot
- Single route app: `src/routes/index.tsx` mounts `GameShell` — no page navigation, everything is in-canvas.
- Phase machine: `boot → lobby → deploy → play`, each with its own screen.
- Asset preloader (`preload.ts`): streams all models, textures and audio with a live progress bar + status label before the lobby unlocks.
- Deploy splash: holds until the 3D map is fully built, with a minimum time so it never flickers; now shows percentage readout and extra mobile tips.
- Loading tips: 4 rotating gameplay hints cycling every 3.2s on the deploy screen.
- Orientation gate: asks mobile players to rotate to landscape before playing.
- Brand mark, splash key art and lobby backdrop images.
- FPS counter overlay (toggleable).
- Runtime error capture and error-page hooks for debugging.

## 2. Lobby
- 3D-lit lobby dashboard with Play, Settings, Character, Map, Profile and Store entries.
- Character picker: 6 operatives, each with tagline, colour, accent and a signature power; live 3D capsule preview.
- Map select: choose the arena before deploying.
- Mode select: choose Lone Wolf, Clash Squad or Battle Royale; toggle Ranked vs Casual.
- Weapon shop / armory: buy and equip weapons with credits; sell-all refund.
- Weapon slots: two heavy slots + sidearm, with slot switching and drop-weapon.
- Selected character persists in localStorage.
- Loadout panel: one active power + up to three passive skills + one tactical item; tactical choices include Bounty Token (bonus gold on first kill) and Armor Crate (spawn with random vest + helmet).

## 2. Progression & identity
- Guest login: persistent guest ID generated on first boot, stored in localStorage.
- Operator profile: callsign, level, guest ID, K/D, win rate, total kills, deaths and headshot best.
- Local profile card: edit callsign, view career stats, gold, diamonds, and claim Booyah Pass rewards.
- Gold currency: earned from every match (base pay + win + kills + headshot bonus), persists across sessions.
- Diamonds currency: premium currency stored in profile, awarded from Luck Royale and Booyah Pass rewards.
- Match rewards: Lone Wolf Arena reports match results and applies gold/XP/character progress to the profile.
- Ranked ladder: Ranked matches award rank points; tier updates in profile (Bronze → Heroic).
- Luck Royale store: gacha-style spinning wheel in the lobby that spends Gold for random gold, diamond, XP or bonus spins.
- Booyah Pass tier tracking with claimable rewards: each tier grants gold and/or diamonds; UI lists claimable tiers and one-tap claim.
- Character Link system: characters beyond the starter are unlocked by playing a set number of matches with them; picker shows lock status and remaining matches.

## 3. Characters & powers
- Roster: Howl (Frostline vanguard), Ember (close-quarters rusher), Vireo (recon/flanks), Onyx (bubble breacher), Lumen (support/walls), Nyx (silent marksman).

- Each power has duration, cooldown, HUD ring, colour and aura VFX (`powerFx.ts`).
- Power effect channels: damage taken, damage dealt, fire rate, recoil, move speed, HP regen, one-shot shield, instant reload, projected barrier dome.
- Barrier dome (`barrierDome.ts`): projected bubble that blocks all incoming fire while active.

## 4. Maps & world
- Frostline Depot — 2v2 industrial duel, fixed blue/red spawns.
- Timber Outpost — 4v4 woodland compound, separate low-poly collision mesh, ground-snapped spawns, fenced hard bounds.
- Map barrier system (`mapBarrier.ts`): invisible hard walls so players can never leave the arena.
- Procedural arena scene builder (`arenaScene.ts`) for the base compound.
- Day skybox with configurable palette and horizon (`skybox.ts`).
- Baked vertex lighting (`bakeLighting.ts`) — fast lighting path plus blob shadows.
- Weather (`weather.ts`): GPU-only rain and snow, max two draw calls, plus lightning flashes that brighten sky/fog and trigger delayed thunder.
- Collision system (`collision.ts`): merged collider, tiled collision, lazy tile warm-up, nearby-tile queries, step-up and wall probes.

Enemy skill is selectable in Settings > Gameplay.
- Safe zone / electrical storm: a shrinking circle that starts covering the arena and damages anyone outside it, forcing fights to a central duel ring.
- Throwables: frag (5s fuse, 300 dmg), flashbang (1.7s fuse, 16 m blind — whiteout for the player, bots hold fire ~3s), smoke (billboard cloud that blocks bot line of sight for 9s) and decoy (fake gunshots, minimap bait, draws bots). Cycle with `G` on desktop or the chip above the grenade button on touch.
- Melee deflection: Pan, Titanium Bat and Katana block ~35% of shots that hit the back; available in the shop and on some bots.

## Known gaps vs `.lovable/plan.md`
No social accounts, guilds, friends, chat or voice. No BR mode, plane/drop sequence, loot/attachments, backpacks, vehicles, ziplines, knock/revive, spectating or ranked points. Tactical items Scanner, Bonfire, Airdrop and Leg Pockets have UI slots but no in-match logic yet.
